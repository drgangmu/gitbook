# All Mathematics You need to know

This is a book provided for graduate students.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

It gives a lot of concept of mathematics, e.g.:

* Vector Field, Manifolds, Gradient, Divergence, Curl, Curvature,&#x20;
* Axiom of Choice
* Groups, Rings, Ideals, Fields
* Cantor Set
* Heating Equations&#x20;
* etc.

I feel it is great for first year undergraduates to have an overview of mathematics to build up mathematics intuition. And then to follow up the books to have deep dive for each directions with exercises.
